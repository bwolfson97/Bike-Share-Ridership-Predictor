# Dog-Identifier
## Overview
The 2nd project of my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. I implement a CNN using Python and Keras to identify dog breeds in images. 
I build a model from scratch, as well as apply transfer learning to quickly train a high-performing model (over 85% accuracy).

Starter code available [here](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project).
